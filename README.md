# What is "Lite"?

Lite is a small and lighweight API for SQLite3.  
It facilitates the process of building and manipulating
databases with SQLite3 and provides supports of some of  
the limitations of SQLite itself.

While SQLiteâ€™s SQL is good and has many great features, there  
are some things it currently does not implement. __*Lite*__ offers  
a set of solutions or implementations of some of these limitations.


# Features  

1. A simple and easy to use interface to create and manipulate  
   SQLite databases.  

2. Implementation for some of the most SQLite limitations.  


3. Support for diffrent __*ALTER TABLE*__ commands: 

  **SQLite** only supports the `RENAME TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN`  
  variants of the `ALTER TABLE` command. Other kinds of operations  
  such as `DROP COLUMN`, `ALTER COLUMN`, and `ADD CONSTRAINT` are  
  not implemented. __*Lite*__ supports and implements all the  
  previous commands except `ADD CONSTRAINT`.

4. Friendly Syntax
  e.g: 
      ```python
      from lite.lite import DB

      # Create a new table
      db = DB("TESTING.db")
      db.tables.create('employer', ['name', 'email', 'age'])


      # Create a new column
      db.columns.add('phone', ftype="INTEGER")
      ```
